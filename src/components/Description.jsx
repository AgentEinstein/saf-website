          SAF, at UC Riverside, is Riverside&apos;s South Asian Club. We aim to
          serve as the umbrella for all organizations <br></br>
          that identify as South Asian. We are politically oriented with the
          goal of raising awarness of the diaspora <br></br> experience and
          various social injustices that have occured in South Asia. We are also
          socially and culturally <br></br> oriented, striving to have the South
          Asia student population celebrate culture through festivals and
          <br></br> inclusive religous events.
