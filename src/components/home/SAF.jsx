        SAF, at UC Riverside, is Riversideâ€™s South Asian Club. We aim to serve
        as the umbrella for all organizations that identify as South Asian. We
        are politically oriented with the goal of raising awareness of the
        diaspora experience and various social injustices that have occurred in
        South Asia. We are also socially and culturally oriented, striving to
        have the South Asian student population celebrate culture through
        festivals and inclusive religious events.
